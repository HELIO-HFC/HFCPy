``hfcpy`` is a Python package for the users of the HELIO Heliophysics Feature
Catalogue (HFC). It provides:

- ``hfcpy.api``, a Python client of the HELIO Query Interface (HQI) of the HFC,
  usable on its own to query the catalogue;
- ``hfcpy.hfcviewer``, a graphical viewer of the HFC observations and features,
  run with the ``hfcviewer`` command;
- ``hfcpy.improlib``, image processing routines (e.g. to decode the chain codes
  of the feature contours).

Visit http://voparis-helio.obspm.fr/hfc-gui/ for more information about the HFC.

HFCPy requires Python 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14 (with Tkinter for the viewer).


INSTALLATION
============

The project is managed with `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_.

To install the ``hfcviewer`` command, run::

    uv tool install .

To use the HQI client in your own project, add it as a dependency, optionally
with the ``pandas`` and/or ``astropy`` extras::

    uv add "hfcpy[pandas,astropy]"

or, with pip::

    pip install "hfcpy[pandas,astropy]"

To use the development version, install it from the ``develop`` branch::

    uv add "hfcpy @ git+https://github.com/HELIO-HFC/HFCPy.git@develop"

To set up a development environment, run::

    uv sync


VIEWER
======

To run the hfcViewer, enter::

    uv run hfcviewer

or, equivalently::

    uv run python -m hfcpy.hfcviewer

For instance, to display the Meudon H-alpha observation nearest to a date::

    uv run hfcviewer -d 2012-06-01T12:00:00 -o Meudon -i Spectroheliograph -w Halpha

To display help, run::

    uv run hfcviewer --help

Note: some old uv-managed Python builds (e.g. 3.12.12, 3.14.2) cannot load
Tcl/Tk ("Can't find a usable init.tcl"); install a newer patch release with
``uv python install``.


HQI CLIENT
==========

The HFC is queried through the HELIO Query Interface (HQI), a SOAP web service
returning VOTables. ``hfcpy.api.HQIClient`` wraps all its methods:

=====================================  ====================  ================================================
Client method                          HQI method            Description
=====================================  ====================  ================================================
``tables()``                           ``getTableNames``     Names of the tables of the HFC
``fields(table)``                      ``getTableFields``    Names of the fields of a table
``select(table, what, where, ...)``    ``SQLSelect``         SQL query (``WHAT``, ``WHERE``, ``ORDER BY``...)
``time_query(table, start, end)``      ``TimeQuery``         Rows observed between two dates
``query(table, start, end, where)``    ``Query``             Rows observed between two dates, with conditions
``call(method, **params)``             any                   Raw call of any method of the service
=====================================  ====================  ================================================

and adds a few helpers:

- ``nearest(table, date)``, ``previous(table, date)``, ``next(table, date)``:
  the row observed nearest to, before or after a date;
- ``features(feature, start, end)``: the features ("active regions",
  "sunspots", "filaments", "prominences", "coronal holes", "type III"...)
  observed between two dates;
- ``quicklook(row)``: the quicklook image (PIL) of an observation.

The main tables are ``VIEW_OBS_HQI`` (observations), ``VIEW_PP_HQI``
(pre-processed observations), ``VIEW_AR_HQI`` (active regions), ``VIEW_SP_HQI``
(sunspots), ``VIEW_CH_HQI`` (coronal holes), ``VIEW_FIL_HQI`` (filaments),
``VIEW_PRO_HQI`` (prominences), ``VIEW_RS_HQI`` (radio sources), ``VIEW_T2_HQI``
and ``VIEW_T3_HQI`` (type II and III radio bursts), and ``FRC_INFO`` (feature
recognition codes).

Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``where`` arguments accept either a raw string, or a mapping
``{field: condition}`` (conditions are combined with AND):

=========================  ================================  =========================
Condition                  ``select`` (SQL)                  ``query`` (HQI syntax)
=========================  ================================  =========================
``"SDO"``                  ``OBSERVAT = 'SDO'``              ``OBSERVAT,SDO``
``(10, 50)``               ``AREA BETWEEN 10 AND 50``        ``AREA,10/50``
``(10, None)``             ``AREA >= 10``                    ``AREA,10/``
``["SDO", "SOHO"]``        ``OBSERVAT IN ('SDO', 'SOHO')``   ``OBSERVAT,SDO,SOHO``
``None``                   ``NOAA_NUMBER IS NULL``           (not supported)
=========================  ================================  =========================

Dates can be given as ``datetime`` objects or ISO 8601 strings
(``"2012-06-01"``, ``"2012-06-01T12:00:00"``).

Beware: string comparisons are case-sensitive, and most of the HFC values are
upper-case (``OBSERVAT = 'SDO'``, ``INSTRUME = 'HMI'``, ``TELESCOP = 'CONTINUUM'``...).
Use ``hqi.select(table, what="DISTINCT OBSERVAT, INSTRUME")`` to list them.

Responses
~~~~~~~~~

The query methods return a ``QueryResponse``, which gives access to:

- the rows, as dictionaries ``{FIELD: value}`` (field names are upper-cased):
  iterate on the response, or use ``response.rows``, ``response.first()``,
  ``response[0]``, ``len(response)``;
- the tables (``response.tables``, ``response.table("VIEW_AR_HQI")``), with their
  fields description (``table.fields``: name, datatype, unit, ucd, null value);
- the information returned by the service (``response.status``,
  ``response.query_string``, ``response.info``);
- the original VOTable document (``response.votable``, ``response.save(path)``);
- the whole VOTable as a dictionary (``response.to_dict()``), or as returned by
  the former client (``response.header`` and ``response.tabledata``);
- a pandas DataFrame (``response.to_pandas()``) or an astropy Table
  (``response.to_astropy()``), if pandas or astropy are installed.

By default, the values are converted according to the VOTable datatypes
(``int``, ``float``, ``datetime`` for the dates, ``None`` for the null values).
Use ``HQIClient(typed=False)`` to keep them as strings, as returned by the
service, or ``HQIClient(parse_dates=False)`` to only keep the dates as strings.

The errors raise a ``HQIError``: ``HQIConnectionError`` if the service can not
be reached, ``HQIQueryError`` if the query has failed (e.g. invalid SQL).

Examples
~~~~~~~~

List the tables of the HFC and the fields of a table::

    from hfcpy.api import HQIClient

    hqi = HQIClient()
    print(hqi.tables())
    print(hqi.fields("VIEW_AR_HQI"))

Get the SDO/HMI continuum observation nearest to a date, and save its quicklook image::

    obs = hqi.nearest(
        "VIEW_OBS_HQI",
        "2012-06-01T12:00:00",
        where={"OBSERVAT": "SDO", "INSTRUME": "HMI", "TELESCOP": "CONTINUUM"},
    )
    print(obs["DATE_OBS"], obs["NAXIS1"], obs["CDELT1"], obs["QCLK_FNAME"])
    hqi.quicklook(obs).save("hmi.png")

Get the positions of the NOAA active regions detected on SDO images during a day::

    ars = hqi.select(
        "VIEW_AR_HQI",
        what="DATE_OBS, NOAA_NUMBER, FEAT_HG_LAT_DEG, FEAT_HG_LONG_DEG, FEAT_AREA_DEG2",
        where={
            "OBSERVAT": "SDO",
            "NOAA_NUMBER": (1, None),
            "DATE_OBS": ("2012-06-01", "2012-06-02"),
        },
        order_by="DATE_OBS, NOAA_NUMBER",
    )
    for row in ars:
        print(row["DATE_OBS"], row["NOAA_NUMBER"], row["FEAT_HG_LAT_DEG"], row["FEAT_HG_LONG_DEG"])

Get the sunspots detected on SDO images as a pandas DataFrame::

    spots = hqi.features(
        "sunspots", "2012-06-01T00:00:00", "2012-06-01T12:00:00", where={"OBSERVAT": "SDO"}
    )
    df = spots.to_pandas()
    print(df[["DATE_OBS", "FEAT_X_ARCSEC", "FEAT_Y_ARCSEC", "FEAT_AREA_DEG2"]])

Use the HQI ``Query`` method to get the large active regions (more than 50 square degrees)::

    big = hqi.query(
        "VIEW_AR_HQI",
        "2012-06-01T00:00:00",
        "2012-06-02T00:00:00",
        where={"OBSERVAT": "SDO", "FEAT_AREA_DEG2": (50, None)},
    )
    print({row["NOAA_NUMBER"] for row in big})

Count the type III radio bursts detected in 2010 (SQL functions can be used)::

    count = hqi.select(
        "VIEW_T3_HQI", what="COUNT(*) AS N", where={"DATE_OBS": ("2010-01-01", "2011-01-01")}
    )
    print(count.first()["N"])

Follow the evolution of a tracked filament::

    filament = hqi.features(
        "filaments", "2011-06-01", "2011-06-02", what="TRACK_ID", where="TRACK_ID > 0", limit=1
    ).first()
    track = hqi.select(
        "VIEW_FIL_HQI",
        what="DATE_OBS, FEAT_HG_LAT_DEG, FEAT_HG_LONG_DEG, SKE_LENGTH_DEG",
        where={"TRACK_ID": filament["TRACK_ID"]},
        order_by="DATE_OBS",
    )

Read a large result page by page (``limit`` and ``offset``)::

    offset = 0
    while True:
        page = hqi.select(
            "VIEW_SP_HQI",
            what="DATE_OBS, FEAT_AREA_DEG2",
            where={"DATE_OBS": ("2012-06-01", "2012-06-02")},
            order_by="DATE_OBS",
            limit=1000,
            offset=offset,
        )
        ...  # process page.rows
        if len(page) < 1000:
            break
        offset += 1000

Save the VOTable, or convert it to a dictionary or to an astropy Table::

    response = hqi.select("VIEW_AR_HQI", what="DATE_OBS, R_SUN", limit=3)
    response.save("result.xml")
    data = response.to_dict()  # {"description", "info", "tables": [{"name", "fields", "rows"}]}
    table = response.to_astropy()

Handle the errors::

    from hfcpy.api import HQIError

    try:
        hqi.select("VIEW_AR_HQI", where="NO_SUCH_FIELD = 1")
    except HQIError as err:
        print(err)


DEVELOPMENT
===========

Install the git hooks (ruff, mypy, gitleaks...)::

    uv run pre-commit install

Run the checks and the tests::

    uv run pre-commit run --all-files
    uv run pytest

Tests querying the live HFC web service are deselected by default, run them with::

    uv run pytest -m network

The continuous integration runs the checks and the tests on Python 3.12, 3.13
and 3.14, then builds the package. It is available for GitLab (``.gitlab-ci.yml``)
and GitHub Actions (``.github/workflows/ci.yml``), and is triggered from the web
interface, through the API, or when a tag is pushed. On GitHub, it can be
triggered through the API with a ``workflow_dispatch`` event, or a
``repository_dispatch`` event of type ``ci``::

    gh workflow run ci.yml --ref develop

The development is done on the ``develop`` branch; the ``master`` branch only
receives the tagged releases of the package.

The badges at the top of this file give the status of the last GitHub Actions
run on the ``develop`` branch, the coverage of the tests on this branch, the
tested Python versions and the licence. The coverage badge is updated by the CI runs on
``develop``, which push a ``coverage.json`` file to the ``badges`` branch. The
Python versions of the badge must be the ones of the ``pyproject.toml``
classifiers and of the CI matrices (this is checked by the tests). On GitLab,
the pipeline and coverage badges can be added in *Settings > General > Badges*.


RELEASES
========

The development is done on ``develop``; the ``master`` branch only receives the
releases. To publish a new version of ``hfcpy`` on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/hfcpy/>`_:

1. update the version (e.g. ``uv version --bump minor``) and the ``CHANGELOG.rst``
   on ``develop``;
2. merge ``develop`` into ``master``;
3. tag the merge commit on ``master`` with the version, and push the tag::

       git tag v0.3.0
       git push origin v0.3.0

The CI then runs the checks and the tests, builds the package and publishes it
(``publish-pypi`` job). The publication is refused if the tag (``X.Y.Z`` or
``vX.Y.Z``) does not match the version of the package, or if the tagged commit is
not on ``master`` (see ``ci/check-release.sh``). The files already on PyPI are
skipped, so the GitHub and GitLab pipelines can both run on the same tag.

The publication uses the `trusted publishing
<https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/>`_ of PyPI: no token is stored in the
CI, PyPI trusts the CI pipelines declared for the project. This must be
configured once on PyPI:

- before the first release (the ``hfcpy`` project does not exist yet on PyPI), add
  a *pending publisher* in *Your account > Publishing*, with the project name
  ``hfcpy`` and, for GitHub: owner ``HELIO-HFC``, repository ``HFCPy``, workflow
  ``ci.yml``, environment ``pypi``; the first release then creates the project;
- for GitLab, add a publisher in the *Publishing* settings of the ``hfcpy``
  project once it exists (or as the pending publisher, if the first release is
  made from GitLab), with the GitLab namespace and project, the top-level
  pipeline file ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` and the environment ``pypi``.

On GitHub, protection rules (e.g. a required reviewer) can be added to the ``pypi``
environment in *Settings > Environments*, to approve each publication.
